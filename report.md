## 5. Methodology & Reasoning

### How Predictions Are Made

1. **Monthly Trend Analysis (Primary)**
   - Calculate month-over-month changes in Aadhar updates
   - Identify trend direction (increasing/decreasing)
   - Extrapolate next month's expected updates using linear trend

2. **News Adjustment (Secondary)**
   - Analyze current news sentiment for each state
   - Apply adjustment factor (0.5x to 1.5x) to base prediction
   - Positive economic news boosts prediction, negative news reduces it

3. **Probability Calculation**
   - `Probability = (State's Final Prediction / Total Predictions) × 100%`
